Main folder: features repeat this structure, if needed + contain index.tsx file which represents each feature and group all subfeatures together.

A feature could have the following structure:

```sh
src/features/singleFeature
|
+-- /structure as above/       # structure as above, depends from the content
|
+-- index.ts                   # entry point for the feature, exports everything that should be used outside the feature
```
